This is a program which analyzes large spatial data by classifying each datapoint in a decision tree data structure.
It calculates the entropy of a given dataset, a builds the decision tree accordingly. 
The leafs of the tree represent the labels of the sub dataset.
The leafs are created once all datapoints have the same attribute, when the entropy is sufficient or when the minimum size is reached.
I incorporated the DecisionTree class but the other classes where already implemented by the teacher for the purpose of structuring the project.
